You can run the game following the instructions below.

# How to run the code

1. Using Pipenv (recommended)

    First install the [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io) by this command:

    ```console
    $ pip install pipenv
    ```

    Then clone the project to your local machine.

    ```console
    $ git clone https://github.com/hesamhme/Snake_Game
    ```

    Then install the required packages with the command below:

    ```console
    $ pipenv install
    ```

    And you are good to go :)

2. Using virtualenv

    First install virtualenv by this command:

    ```console
    $ pip install virtualenv
    ```

    Then clone the project to your local machine.

    ```console
    $ git clone https://github.com/hadiMh/Snake_Game
    ```

    Then create the virtual environment in the project folder:

    This will create a venv folder in your project and then activates it.

    ```console
    $ virtualenv venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    ```

    Then install the required packages with the command below:

    ```console
    (venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

# Usage

The only step needed is to run the UI of the app.

At the root directory of the project run:

```console
$ python3 game.py
```
